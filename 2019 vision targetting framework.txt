calculate angle using side lengths and gyro input:

turn all wheels to angling position

if camera feedback shows -5 degrees, rotate 5 degrees

rotate robot -limelight angle degrees until gyro angle gyro input angle + limelight angle degrees


limelightAngle = <proportion with lines>
gyroAngle = get yaw or whatever from AHRS
current sensor = gyro angle + limelight angle

proportional loop set the setpoint to current sensor

( proportional loop: set the speed of all movement motors to P * (current sensor - desired sensor) )

if now the current sensor is X degrees away from target, move on to next step...


strafe to limelight target:


rotate all wheels to the strafe position

set a proportional loop to the x position of the limelight and attach its outputs to wheel movement speed

the desired value for the "sensor" is 0

if now the crosshair is X units away from target, move on to next step...


approach limelight target:


rotate all wheels to the forward position

set a proportional loop to the area of the limelight and attach its outputs to wheel movement speed

the desired value for the area will be somewhere around 90

if this value is reached, the search is complete
